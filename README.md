# Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning! You’re joining thousands of learners currently enrolled in the course. I'm excited to have you in the class and look forward to your contributions to the learning community.

## Where To Find The Notebooks For This Course

All notebooks in this course can be run in either Google Colab or Coursera Labs. **You don’t need a local environment set up to follow the coding exercises**. You can simply click the **Open in Colab** badge at the top of the ungraded labs while for the assignments, you will be taken automatically to Coursera Labs. 

However, if you want to run them on your local machine, the ungraded labs and assignments for each week can be found in this [Github](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-1-public/tree/main/C1) repository under the **C1** folder. If you already have git installed on your computer, you can clone it with this command:

<pre>
<code>
git clone https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-1-public
</code>
</pre>

If not, please follow the guides [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install git on your operating system. Once you’ve cloned the repo, you can do a git pull once in a while to make sure that you get the latest updates to the notebooks.

## Package In Use

You will need these packages if you will run the notebooks locally:

<pre>
<code>
    tensorflow==2.7.0
    scikit-learn==1.0.1
    pandas==1.1.5
    matplotlib==3.2.2
    seaborn==0.11.2
</code>
